## Lesson Description

The purpose of this lesson is to understand the implementation of an Instruction Set Architecture and the importance that it plays in the overall heirarchy of Computer Design and Architecture. We will discuss the layers of abstraction that exist between the modern programmer, the student, and the machines we operate on.

The lesson will begin with an introduction to several common ISAs and dive into their binary structures. The first half of the lesson will focus heavily on theory and the ability to conceptualize hardware/software interface. The student will be able to visualalize the processing of information in the language of the hardware and ultimately implement a mock-up of MIPS instructions through a Python interface. This will build the foundation the student will use to understand the Assembly Language module that will draw heavily on the understanding of ISAs.

## Lesson Code Description

The goal of the lesson checkpoints is to have the learner implement a cache from scratch within an existing register/memory hierarchy. The initial program will consist of a bank of registers and blocks of main memory. A group of commands will exist that repeatedly request data from memory. The timing of the commands can be output to represent the performance of the commands. As the learner implements the cache they will see timing improve as well as the effects of different policy implementations.
