## Lesson Description

This lesson will introduce the student to a formal lesson on the binary number system. By now the user has come in contact with binary on a number of occassions although it may not have been thoroughly explained. The lesson will use everyone familiarity with the decimal system to create an understanding of how numbers and information are stored through 'bits' of information. The student will learn why computers and electrical devices use binary and the advantages and disadvantages that that creates. After a binary conversion exercise, this mini lesson will take students on a deep dive into the fundamental microchips that make up the modern computer. By looking at a variety of simple logic gates (AND/OR/NAND/NOT/XOR) the student will be able how binary information is processed and how these components build upon each other to create more robust computing systems.

>After the base of knowledge is build, the follow-on mini lesson will guide students through the processing of complex data transfer and storage, touching on graphics, generic files, network communications and compression.

>The rest of the "Logic Gates" lesson that was produced a few years ago would be an excellent off shoot if the user wanted to take a deep dive into those chips and how they can be built upon to create the more complex chips such as adders, multiplexers, and demultiplexers. I think since it is already created, it would be an easy add to the CS 105 course with hardly any touch up needed at all.

## Lesson Code Description

There will be hardly any coding in this lesson, the goal will be not to distract the user with trying to figure out the code, and rather focus on putting answers into responses so they can be checked against the testing software. It might prompt a user to "fill in the integer represented by: 27" or "Convert 0100101 to decimal and enter your answer in the code on the right."
